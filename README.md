Implementation of seismic based bedload transport models, including the saltation-mode model (Tsai et al., 2012) and multi-mode model (Luong et al., 2024).
# TODO
- Allows grain size distribution (pD) to be called from forward and inverse method
- Multi-mode model implementation
- Particle velocity update
